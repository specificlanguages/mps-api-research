# Refreshing a build project's module imports from disk

Verified signatures against `com.jetbrains:mps:2025.1.2` with `javap`; behavior read from JetBrains/MPS 2025.1 source at
commit `f4d90532bcac5e0339b3161cec38abf49567cffb`. A runtime probe in a headless IDEA environment invoked
`ModuleClassCode.load` and `ModuleLoader.checkAllModules` from an existing project command on both successful and
reported-error paths. Unexpected-exception cleanup remains unverified.

## Direct operation

The build-language intention `Reload Modules From Disk` delegates its entire execution to:

```java
ModuleLoader loader = new ModuleLoader(buildProject, null,
    new LogHandler(Logger.getLogger(ModuleLoader.class)));
loader.checkAllModules(ModuleChecker.CheckType.LOAD_IMPORTANT_PART);
```

It does not use the `EditorContext`. The direct operation is therefore a useful integration entry point without
intention discovery or editor selection. A two-argument constructor delegates to the same null-generation-context path
and permits collecting diagnostics:

```java
import jetbrains.mps.build.mps.util.ModuleChecker;
import jetbrains.mps.build.mps.util.ModuleLoader;
import jetbrains.mps.messages.IMessageHandler;

// buildProject is the attached jetbrains.mps.build.structure.BuildProject SNode.
// Invoke inside the host's model mutation command; collect diagnostics before deciding to save.
ModuleLoader loader = new ModuleLoader(buildProject, messageHandler);
loader.checkAllModules(ModuleChecker.CheckType.LOAD_IMPORTANT_PART);
```

`messageHandler` implements `IMessageHandler`. These are public methods on generated build-language utility classes, not
a version-independent platform API. The classes ship in `plugins/mps-build/languages/build/jetbrains.mps.build.mps.jar`
within the MPS distribution, rather than `lib/`. Their build-language dependencies must be available through the host's
module/classloading integration.

Exact relevant signatures:

```java
public ModuleLoader(@NotNull SNode buildProject, @NotNull IMessageHandler msgHandler);
public ModuleLoader(@NotNull SNode buildProject, @Nullable TemplateQueryContext genContext,
                    @NotNull IMessageHandler msgHandler);
public void checkAllModules(ModuleChecker.CheckType type);
public ModuleLoader useFileSystem(FileSystem fs);
```

The two-argument path is also used by MPS's `RefreshTestProject_Action` after creating/replacing a build project.
Construction with a null generation context uses `Context.defaultContext()` and initializes path conversion and
visible-module collection from the build project.

## Scope and effects

The argument is the **build project model node**, not the IDE project or the module containing the build model.
`checkAllModules` visits module entries in the project's `parts`, both direct entries and entries in
`BuildMps_Group.modules`, and skips entries without a `path`. Language generators are handled by `ModuleChecker`. It
reads the referenced descriptor files using `DescriptorIOFacade` and temporarily loads modules into a private repository
to inspect their properties.

This refreshes existing build module entries; it does not discover unlisted modules by scanning directories. The build
project must already contain the module imports and usable paths. Dependencies are resolved through `VisibleModules`;
missing visible dependencies can be reported as errors.

`LOAD_IMPORTANT_PART` selects partial import: `(doCheck=false, doPartialImport=true, doFullImport=false)`. Among the
effects are updating names/UUIDs, extracted dependencies, language runtime/accessory/extended-language information,
devkit exports, generator information, extracted model source roots, and Java compilation kind. Obsolete extracted
entries can be removed. It reads descriptors from disk, so unsaved edits to live module descriptors are not its input.

`LOAD_ALL` is a different operation, with `(true, false, true)`: it adds full-import processing such as local
dependencies and dependency optimization, and clears the compact flag. Use `LOAD_IMPORTANT_PART` for the intention's
behavior.

The method mutates the build model in memory and returns `void`; it does not save the model, generate the build script,
or run the build. It reports errors through the message handler and can continue processing other modules. Normal return
therefore does not establish success or atomicity. Collect errors and apply the host's mutation and save/failure policy,
including the possibility of partial changes. It is not a refresh of the live project's module repository or
classloaders.

The private repository is cleaned up after processing. That cleanup is not enclosed in a `finally` block in this
version, so unexpected exceptions can bypass it. The unexpected-exception path still needs runtime coverage; source
inspection alone does not establish its cleanup behavior.

## Loading the generated utility through its MPS module

`ModuleLoader` is generated code owned by the `jetbrains.mps.build.mps` language module. A host whose application
classloader does not include build-language jars can load it through MPS's module classloader with
`jetbrains.mps.tool.run.ModuleClassCode`. That helper ships in `lib/mpsant/mps-tool.jar` and has this public surface in
`com.jetbrains:mps:2025.1.2`:

```java
public ModuleClassCode(String moduleReference);
public void load(Platform platform, String classFQN) throws ClassNotFoundException;
public Optional<Method> instanceMethod(String name, Class<?>... parameterTypes);
public Optional<Method> staticMethod(String name, Class<?>... parameterTypes);
public Optional<Constructor<?>> cons(Class<?>... parameterTypes);
```

The build-language module reference is `0cf935df-4699-4e9c-a132-fa109541cba3(jetbrains.mps.build.mps)`. `load` resolves
that module in the platform's `MPSModuleRepository`, asks `ClassLoaderManager` for its classloader, and loads the
requested class from it. Module dependencies therefore remain under MPS classloading rather than being copied onto the
host application classpath. The module must already be registered and classloadable.

`cons` and `instanceMethod` return reflection objects for public concrete members whose parameter types match. They
accept host-loaded MPS OpenAPI types such as `SNode` and `IMessageHandler` because those APIs are shared with the module
classloader. `ModuleChecker.CheckType`, however, belongs to the build-language module classloader: obtain that class
through the loaded `ModuleLoader` classloader and select its `LOAD_IMPORTANT_PART` enum constant before looking up
`checkAllModules`.

`ModuleClassCode.load` performs module resolution and class loading inside a write action on the platform repository. A
runtime probe with MPS 2025.1.2 confirmed that it can run from an existing project command in a headless IDEA
environment and that the subsequent reflective `ModuleLoader` call completes there.

## Executing through intentions

The definition key is:

```text
jetbrains.mps.build.mps.intentions.ReloadModulesFromDisk_Intention
```

The factory is registered for `jetbrains.mps.build.structure.BuildProject`, is available in child nodes, and is not
parameterized. Applicability requires a descendant of concept `BuildMps_AbstractModule`. With a working editor context,
discover this key on the build project and execute the returned executable on that build project through the editor
command path described in [intentions.md](intentions.md).

The direct `ModuleLoader` call performs the same operation without the intention manager's editor/typechecking
dependencies. It does not repeat the intention's applicability check, so the caller must supply the proper build project
node.
