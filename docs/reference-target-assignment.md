# Assigning reference targets

In `com.jetbrains:mps:2025.1.2`, `mps-openapi.jar` exposes:

```java
void SNodeAccessUtil.setReferenceTarget(SNode node, SReferenceLink link, SNode target);
```

The target may be null to clear a reference. Use this API to assign a resolved target through MPS reference setter
hooks. An `SReference` supplies its resolved target through `getTargetNode()`; an `SNodeReference` can be resolved with
`resolve(SRepository)`. Resolution can return null. Callers that distinguish an unresolved target from a request to
clear must check resolution before invoking the setter.

`SNodeAccessUtilImpl` obtains the reference constraints descriptor, checks `validate`, assigns the target, and invokes
`onReferenceSet` when validation accepts it. A rejected validation leaves the reference unchanged. Missing reference
constraints descriptors and recursive setter calls use direct native assignment. This API does not constitute full model
validation.
