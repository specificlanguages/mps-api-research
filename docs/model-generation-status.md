# Detecting a stale module: is a model's generated output outdated w.r.t. its sources?

**Question this answers:** given a module (a language, generator, or solution) that has been built, how do you detect —
headless — that its generated output and therefore its compiled runtime are **outdated** with respect to the module's
model sources on disk? I.e. the "built but stale" case: the `.mps` sources changed (or were reverted) after the runtime
was generated, so name lookup through the compiled runtime can return a concept whose identity contradicts the current
sources.

**Answer:** `jetbrains.mps.generator.ModelGenerationStatusManager.generationRequired(SModel)` returns `true` exactly
when MPS requires generation. This includes unsaved changes, an unavailable current hash, missing generation evidence,
and differing hashes. The result does not establish that compiled output is chronologically older than its sources. This
is the same detection MPS's own command-line make uses to skip unmodified models, so it works headless.

Verified against MPS **2025.1.2** (`com.jetbrains:mps:2025.1.2`), cross-read in the **MPS2025.1** source checkout.
Source paths below are relative to the [JetBrains/MPS](https://github.com/JetBrains/MPS) repository root.

## The API

```java
jetbrains.mps.generator.ModelGenerationStatusManager            // mps-generator.jar
  boolean generationRequired(SModel md)
  Collection<SModel> getModifiedModels(Collection<? extends SModel> models)   // batch: the subset that generationRequired
```

Obtain it as a **project component**, the same way MPS's headless make worker does:

```kotlin
val mgsm = project.getComponent(ModelGenerationStatusManager::class.java)
```

`jetbrains.mps.tool.builder.make.BaseGeneratorWorker` (`core/tool/builder/source_gen/.../BaseGeneratorWorker.java`
~:120) — the ant / command-line generation worker — obtains it exactly this way and calls `getModifiedModels(...)` to
implement its "skip unmodified models" option. That worker runs headless, so this path is confirmed headless-safe. The
class is a `CoreComponent`; `getComponent` is the supported accessor (there is no `getInstance()`).

## What `generationRequired` compares

Source: `core/generator/source/jetbrains/mps/generator/ModelGenerationStatusManager.java` (~:150). The logic, in order:

```java
public boolean generationRequired(SModel md) {
  if (!(md instanceof GeneratableSModel)) return false;          // not a generatable model
  GeneratableSModel sm = (GeneratableSModel) md;
  if (!sm.isGeneratable()) return false;                         // generation disabled for it
  if (sm instanceof EditableSModel && ((EditableSModel) sm).isChanged()) return true;  // unsaved in-memory edits
  String currentHash = currentHash(sm);                         // actual current content
  if (currentHash == null) return true;                         // can't tell -> assume stale
  String generatedHash = getLastKnownHash(sm);                  // hash recorded at last generation
  return !currentHash.equals(generatedHash);
}
```

So `true` means one of: it has unsaved edits, its current content hash cannot be computed, or its current content hash
does not equal the recorded generation hash. A missing or unreadable recorded hash also satisfies that last comparison.

### `currentHash` — the actual current content (reads the file)

`currentHash(sm)` first asks `ModelDigestHelper.getModelHash(md)`
(`core/persistence/source/jetbrains/mps/persistence/ModelDigestHelper.java`), which consults registered
`DigestProvider`s (an IDEA workspace-index lookup). **Headless there is normally no such provider**, so it returns
`null` and `generationRequired` falls back to `md.getModelHash()` on the model itself.

`GeneratableSModel.getModelHash()` (impl in `core/persistence/source/jetbrains/mps/persistence/LazyLoadFacility.java`
~:68) is `ModelDigestUtil.hash(getSource(), textBased)` — it hashes the model's **`DataSource`** (the `.mps` file's
stream) directly, with the in-source comment "hash value representing actual model content (i.e. no cached values)". It
reads the current file bytes, so `currentHash` reflects **on-disk source state** (after a VFS refresh; see
[external file refresh](external-file-runtime-refresh.md)), not a cached digest. The data source can still use IDEA's
cached file contents until that refresh completes.

### `getLastKnownHash` — the hash recorded at last generation (reads the `generated` cache file)

`getLastKnownHash` reads `GenerationDependenciesCache.get(sm).getModelHash()`
(`core/generator/source/jetbrains/mps/generator/impl/dependencies/GenerationDependenciesCache.java`). That is parsed
from a per-model cache file named **`generated`**, located under the model's generation-output cache directory
(`GenerationTargetFacet.getOutputCacheLocation(model)` — i.e. alongside `source_gen`). It holds the model hash captured
the last time the model was generated. If sources are reverted without cleaning `source_gen` or its caches, this file
still holds the pre-revert hash, so it differs from the reverted `currentHash` and `generationRequired` returns `true`.
After generation, the file contains the new hash and the two match again.

## Reading current generation evidence

`GenerationDependenciesCache` has a public constructor but is not exposed by the project component host in MPS 2025.1.2.
An independently constructed instance uses the same parser and model-cache layout; it does not share the generation
manager's memoized records.

Its protected `getCacheFile(SModel)` selects among `GenerationTargetFacet.stream(model)` output-cache locations: append
`generated`, skip directories, prefer the first existing file, otherwise use the first nonexistent candidate. No
candidate means that the location cannot be determined, not that a known file is missing.

IDEA's `IdeaFile.openInputStream()` delegates to `VirtualFile.getInputStream()`, so even a new parsed-cache instance can
read cached file bytes before file refresh. Synchronous recursive refresh of the directory containing the generation
records, followed by `ReloadManager.flush()`, allows a fresh `GenerationDependenciesCache` to read the updated records
through the normal IDEA-backed files; see [external file refresh](external-file-runtime-refresh.md).

Verified with a live headless MPS 2025.1.2 environment: after a successful build, changing the recorded hash directly on
disk was invisible to the generation manager and to a new cache using IDEA-backed files without refresh. With refresh
before each operation, a fresh standard cache observed the mismatching hash, the restored matching record, a missing
record, and a record without a hash, without a build or restart. Custom Java-IO-backed cache-file selection is not
needed for these refreshed locations. Locations outside the refreshed directories require their own refresh.

`ModelCacheReloader` in
`workbench/mps-platform/jetbrains.mps.ide.platform/source_gen/jetbrains/mps/ide/platform/watching` also listens for IDEA
file events affecting `generated` files and calls the generation manager's `invalidateData(IFile)`. That invalidation
depends on file events; it is not an independent disk scan.

Relevant sources: `core/kernel/source/jetbrains/mps/generator/cache/BaseModelCache.java`,
`core/generator/source/jetbrains/mps/generator/impl/dependencies/GenerationDependenciesCache.java`,
`workbench/mps-platform/source/jetbrains/mps/ide/vfs/IdeaFile.java`, and
`core/vfs/source/jetbrains/mps/vfs/VFSManager.java`.

## From a module to its generation status

A module is stale iff any of its generatable models needs regeneration. Enumerate with `SModule.getModels()` and filter,
inside a read action — again mirroring `BaseGeneratorWorker.collectResources`:

```kotlin
project.modelAccess.runReadAction {
  val mgsm = project.getComponent(ModelGenerationStatusManager::class.java)
  val staleModels = mgsm.getModifiedModels(module.models.toList())   // == models.filter { mgsm.generationRequired(it) }
  val outdated = staleModels.isNotEmpty()
}
```

For a language, its structure/behavior/etc. models are all in its module; any of them being stale means the compiled
runtime may not match the sources. `getModifiedModels` is just `models.filter(::generationRequired)` collected into a
`LinkedHashSet`, so use whichever reads better.

## Gotchas

- **Read action required.** Every call reads the repository / model sources.
- **The last-known-hash cache is memoized in memory, keyed by model reference.** `BaseModelCache.get`
  (`core/generator/source/jetbrains/mps/generator/cache/BaseModelCache.java`) parses the `generated` file **once** and
  caches the parsed `GenerationDependencies`; it does not re-stat the file on later calls. It is invalidated by
  `ModelGenerationStatusManager`'s repository listener on model reload / replace / add / remove (`invalidateData`), by
  `invalidateData(IFile)` for external file-change notifications, and it is refreshed by a make (generation calls
  `update(...)` with the new dependencies). So a `generationRequired` result reflects the on-disk `generated` file as of
  the first query or the last invalidation — fine for "detect stale at startup, refuse, and let a `make` clear it", but
  do not expect it to notice a `generated` file rewritten by an _external_ process without one of those invalidations.
- **`currentHash`, by contrast, is recomputed from the data source each call** (no memoization in the headless
  fallback), so the _current_ side always reflects the live source; only the _last-generated_ side is cached as above.
- **Null cache location reads as stale.** If a model has generatable content but no readable `generated` file
  (`getLastKnownHash` returns `null`) while `currentHash` is non-null, `generationRequired` returns `true`. A
  never-generated model thus reads as "needs generation", which is correct for the unbuilt case but means the signal
  alone does not distinguish "unbuilt" from "built-but-stale" — pair it with the runtime-loaded check
  (`LanguageRegistry.withModuleRuntime`, see `language-runtime-loading.md`) if you need to tell those apart.
- **Non-generatable and read-only models report `false`.** Deployed/packaged modules (loaded from jars, no editable
  source) are not `GeneratableSModel` / not generatable, so they never report stale — appropriate, since you cannot edit
  or regenerate them anyway.

## Re-verify triggers

- On an MPS upgrade, re-read `ModelGenerationStatusManager.generationRequired` — the three-way hash logic and the
  headless fallback from `ModelDigestHelper.getModelHash` to `GeneratableSModel.getModelHash()` are the load-bearing
  parts.
- If `getComponent(ModelGenerationStatusManager.class)` ever returns null headless, check that the generator platform
  component is registered in the environment (it is a `CoreComponent`, initialised by `MPSGenerator`).
- The `generated` cache-file name and its `GenerationTargetFacet` location are stable back to 2022; re-check if
  generation output layout changes.
